Therefore, the total luminosity of the binary system when the smaller star is behind the larger star is just the luminosity of the larger star, $L_1$.\n\nThe change in bolometric magnitude, $\\Delta m_{\\text{bol}}$, is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = m_{\\text{bol, total}} - m_{\\text{bol, individual}} \\]\n\nwhere $m_{\\text{bol, total}}$ is the bolometric magnitude of the binary system when the smaller star is behind the larger star, and $m_{\\text{bol, individual}}$ is the bolometric magnitude of the larger star when the smaller star is not behind it.\n\nSince the bolometric magnitude is proportional to the logarithm of the luminosity, we have:\n\n\\[ m_{\\text{bol, total}} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) \\]\n\\[ m_{\\text{bol, individual}} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1 + L_2}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1 + 4 L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{5 L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) \\]\n\nSo, the change in bolometric magnitude is:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) - \\left( -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{5 L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) \\right) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) + 2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{5 L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = 2.5 \\left( \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{5 L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) - \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{L_{\\odot}} \\right) \\right) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = 2.5 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{5 L_1 / L_{\\odot}}{L_1 / L_{\\odot}} \\right) = 2.5 \\log_{10} (5) \\]\n\nUsing the value of $\\log_{10} (5) \\approx 0.699$, we get:\n\n\\[ \\Delta m_{\\text{bol}} = 2.5 \\times 0.699 \\approx 1.7475 \\]\n\nSo, the change in bolometric magnitude is approximately:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1.75} \\]\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the change in bolometric magnitude\nlog_10_5 = math.log10(5)\ndelta_m_bol = 2.5 * log_10_5\nprint(delta_m_bol)\n```\n\nGiven that the function $f(x)$ is an odd function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, and when $x > 0$, $f(x)=1- \\log _{2}x$, determine the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$. To solve the problem, we need to determine the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ given that $f(x)$ is an odd function and $f(x) = 1 - \\log_2 x$ for $x > 0$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an odd function, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$. This means that for $x < 0$, we can express $f(x)$ as $f(x) = -f(-x) = -(1 - \\log_2 (-x)) = \\log_2 (-x) - 1$.\n\nNow, we need to consider the inequality $f(x) < 0$ for both $x > 0$ and $x < 0$.\n\n1. For $x > 0$, we have $f(x) = 1 - \\log_2 x$. The inequality $f(x) < 0$ becomes:\n   \\[\n   1 - \\log_2 x < 0 \\implies \\log_2 x > 1 \\implies x > 2.\n   \\]\n   So, the solution for $x > 0$ is $x > 2$.\n\n2. For $x < 0$, we have $f(x) = \\log_2 (-x) - 1$. The inequality $f(x) < 0$ becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\log_2 (-x) - 1 < 0 \\implies \\log_2 (-x) < 1 \\implies -x < 2 \\implies x > -2.\n   \\]\n   So, the solution for $x < 0$ is $-2 < x < 0$.\n\nCombining these results, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ is $(-2, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)$.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function for x > 0\nf_pos = 1 - sp.log(x, 2)\n\n# Solve the inequality for x > 0\ninequality_pos = sp.solve(f_pos < 0, x)\n\n# Define the function for x < 0\nf_neg = sp.log(-x, 2) - 1\n\n# Solve the inequality for x < 0\ninequality_neg = sp.solve(f_neg < 0, x)\n\n# Combine the solutions\nsolution_set = sp.Union(inequality_neg, inequality_pos)\nprint(solution_set)\n```\n```output\nTypeError: Input args to Union must be Sets\n```\nThe error indicates that the inputs to the `Union` function must be sets. We need to ensure that the solutions from `solve` are converted to sets before using `Union`. Let's correct the code accordingly:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function for x > 0\nf_pos = 1 - sp.log(x, 2)\n\n# Solve the inequality for x > 0\ninequality_pos = sp.solveset(f_pos < 0, x, domain=sp.S.Reals)\n\n# Define the function for x < 0\nf_neg = sp.log(-x, 2) - 1\n\n# Solve the inequality for x < 0\ninequality_neg = sp.solveset(f_neg < 0, x, domain=sp.S.Reals)\n\n# Combine the solutions\nsolution_set = sp.Union(inequality_neg, inequality_pos)\nprint(solution_set)\n```\n```output\nUnion(Interval.open(-2, 0), Interval.open(2, oo))\n```\nThe output confirms our earlier reasoning. The solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ is the union of the intervals $(-2, 0)$ and $(2, \\infty)$. Therefore, the solution set is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-2, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nGiven the function $f(x)=\\sin (2x+ \\frac {\\pi}{3})+\\sin (2x- \\frac {\\pi}{3})+2\\cos ^{2}x-1$, where $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n1. Find the smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$.\n2. Find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ in the interval $\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]$. Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin (A + B) + \\sin (A - B) = 2 \\sin A \\cos B \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2 \\sin 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin 2x \\]\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos 2x \\]\n\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are attained within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's find the values of \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) at the endpoints of the interval:\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n- When \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\)\n\nThe function \\( \\sin \\theta \\) attains its maximum value of 1 at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and its minimum value of -1 at \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Since \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is within the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right]\\), the maximum value of \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is 1 and the minimum value is -1 within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\("], "pred": ["(-2,0)\\cup(2,\\infty)"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Each combination of inputs (four possible) can cause one of two output values. Therefore the number of possible one-output binary functions of two binary variables is $2^{4}$, or \\boxed{16}.

The general solution for $\\cos(\\phi) = 0$ is:\n   \\[\n   \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\quad \\text{for any integer } n\n   \\]\n   Since $\\phi$ is an odd multiple of $k$, we can write $\\phi = (2m+1)k$ for any integer $m$.

Let's verify this by checking if $k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ works for all odd multiples.

Tritium has one proton and two neutrons.\n2. The proton is composed of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark.\n3. Each neutron is composed of 1 up quark and 2 down quarks.\n\nSo, the total number of up quarks in the tritium nucleus is the sum of the up quarks from the proton and the up quarks from the neutrons.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Number of up quarks in a proton\nup_quarks_proton = 2\n\n# Number of up quarks in a neutron\nup_quarks_neutron = 1\n\n# Tritium has 1 proton and 2 neutrons\ntotal_up_quarks = up_quarks_proton + 2 * up_quarks_neutron\nprint(total_up_quarks)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\nThe total number of up quarks in a tritium ($H^3$) nucleus is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [true]}

Among them, 68 students like watching the sports channel, 55 students like watching the arts channel, and another 3 students do not like watching either channel. How many students like watching both channels? To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion. Let's denote the following:\n\n- \\( A \\) as the set of students who like watching the sports channel.\n- \\( B \\) as the set of students who like watching the arts channel.\n- \\( |A|\\) as the number of students who like watching the sports channel.\n- \\( |B|\\) as the number of students who like watching the arts channel.\n- \\( |A \\cup B|\\) as the number of students who like watching either the sports channel or the arts channel or both.\n- \\( |A \\cap B|\\) as the number of students who like watching both channels.\n\nFrom the problem, we know:\n- \\( |A| = 68 \\)\n- \\( |B| = 55 \\)\n- The total number of students is 100, and 3 students do not like watching either channel. Therefore, the number of students who like watching either channel or both is \\( 100 - 3 = 97 \\). So, \\( |A \\cup B| = 97 \\).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we have:\n\\[ |A \\cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \\cap B| \\]\n\\[ 97 = 68 + 55 - |A \\cap B| \\]\n\nWe can solve for \\( |A \\cap B| \\):\n\\[ |A \\cap B| = 68 + 55 - 97 = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the number of students who like watching both channels is 26.

Simplifying this equation, we get\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\omega \\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\omega \\pi}{6} = 2k\\pi.\n   \\]\n   Combining the terms on the left side, we have\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2\\omega \\pi + \\omega \\pi}{6} = 2k\\pi \\implies \\frac{3\\omega \\pi}{6} = 2k\\pi \\implies \\frac{\\omega \\pi}{2} = 2k\\pi.\n   \\]\n   Dividing both sides by \\(\\pi\\), we get\n   \\[\n   \\frac{\\omega}{2} = 2k \\implies \\omega = 4k.\n   \\]\n   Since \\(\\omega > 0\\), the smallest possible value of \\(\\omega\\) is when \\(k = 1\\), giving \\(\\omega = 4\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\(\\omega\\) is \\(4\\).

Since we are looking for the minimum positive value of \\(\\omega\\), we can directly substitute \\(k = 1\\) into the equation \\(\\omega = 4k\\).\n\nLet's simplify the code to directly compute the minimum value of \\(\\omega\\):\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the equation\nomega = sp.symbols('omega', positive=True)\nk = 1  # Since we are looking for the minimum positive value, we set k = 1\nomega_value = 4 * k\n\nprint(omega_value)\n```\n```output\n4\n```\nThe minimum value of \\(\\omega\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).\n\nThis confirms that the correct answer is \\(C: 4\\).\n\nGiven the function $f(x)=\\sin (2x+ \\frac {\\pi}{3})+\\sin (2x- \\frac {\\pi}{3})+2\\cos ^{2}x-1$, where $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n1. Find the smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$.\n2. Find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ in the interval $\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]$. Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin (A + B) + \\sin (A - B) = 2 \\sin A \\cos B \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2 \\sin 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin 2x \\]\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos 2x \\]\n\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are attained within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's find the values of \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) at the endpoints of the interval:\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n- When \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\)\n\nThe function \\( \\sin \\theta \\) attains its maximum value of 1 at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and its minimum value of -1 at \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Since \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is within the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right]\\), the maximum value of \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is 1 and the minimum value is -1 within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\sqrt"], "pred": ["4"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Equate the energy of the photon to the kinetic energy of the electron and solve for the velocity $v$.\n\nLet's use the following values:\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J s}$\n- Speed of light, $c = 3.00 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s}$\n- Wavelength, $\\lambda = 4.28 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n- Mass of the electron, $m = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31} \\text{ kg}$\n\nNow let's calculate the energy of the photon and then the velocity of the electron.\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy of the photon:\n\\[ E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\]\n\nThen we equate this energy to the kinetic energy of the electron:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E \\]\n\\[ v^2 = \\frac{2E}{m} \\]\n\\[ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}} \\]\n\nLet's perform these calculations in Python.\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nh = 6.626e-34  # Planck's constant in J s\nc = 3.00e8     # Speed of light in m/s\nlambda_ = 4.28e-7  # Wavelength in m\nm = 9.11e-31   # Mass of the electron in kg\n\n# Energy of the photon\nE = h * c / lambda_\n\n# Velocity of the electron\nv = math.sqrt(2 * E / m)\nv_formatted = \"{:.2e}\".format(v)\nprint(v_formatted)\n```\n```output\n1.03e+06\n```\nThe velocity of the electron after the interaction is $\\boxed{1.03 \\times 10^6 \\text{ m/s}}$.\n\nA certain school has 100 teachers, 600 male students, and 500 female students. A stratified sampling method is used to draw a sample of size n from all the teachers and students. If it is known that a total of 40 female students were sampled, then the value of n is ( ).\n\nA: 96\nB: 192\nC: 95\nD: 190 To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of stratified sampling. In stratified sampling, the sample size from each stratum (subgroup) is proportional to the size of the stratum relative to the entire population.\n\nHere, the total population consists of 100 teachers, 600 male students, and 500 female students, giving a total population of 1200 individuals. The sample size from the female students is given as 40. Let's denote the total sample size by \\( n \\).\n\nThe proportion of female students in the population is \\(\\frac{500}{1200} = \\frac{5}{12}\\). Since the sample is stratified, the proportion of female students in the sample should be the same as in the population. Therefore, the number of female students in the sample should be \\(\\frac{5}{12} \\times n\\).\n\nWe know that the number of female students in the sample is 40. So we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12} \\times n = 40\n\\]\nSolving for \\( n \\):\n\\[\nn = 40 \\times \\frac{12}{5} = 96\n\\]\n\nSo the total sample size \\( n \\) is 96. Let's confirm this with Python code.\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_teachers = 100\ntotal_male_students = 600\ntotal_female_students = 500\nsample_female_students = 40\n\n# Total population\ntotal_population = total_teachers + total_male_students + total_female_students\n\n# Proportion of female students in the population\nproportion_female_students = total_female_students / total_population\n\n# Calculate the total sample size n\ntotal_sample_size = sample_female_students / proportion_female_students\nprint(total_sample_size)\n```\n```output\n96.0\n```\nThe total sample size \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{96}\\).\n\nGiven the function $f(x)=\\sin (ωx+ \\frac {π}{3})$, the distance between its two adjacent symmetry axes is $π$. Determine the value of $ω$. To determine the value of $\\omega$ for the function $f(x) = \\sin(\\omega x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ given that the distance between its two adjacent symmetry axes is $\\pi$, we need to understand the periodicity and symmetry properties of the sine function.\n\nThe function $\\sin(\\theta)$ has symmetry axes at $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for integer values of $k$. For the function $f(x) = \\sin(\\omega x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$, the symmetry axes occur when $\\omega x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$. Solving for $x$, we get:\n\\[ \\omega x + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi \\]\n\\[ \\omega x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3} + k\\pi \\]\n\\[ \\omega x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + k\\pi \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{\\pi}{6\\omega} + \\frac{k\\pi}{\\omega} \\]\n\nThe distance between two adjacent symmetry axes (i.e., for $k$ and $k+1$) is:\n\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6\\omega} + \\frac{(k+1)\\pi}{\\omega} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{6\\omega} + \\frac{k\\pi}{\\omega} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} \\]\n\nWe are given that this distance is $\\pi$, so:\n\\[ \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} = \\pi \\]\n\\[ \\omega = 1 \\]\n\nLet's confirm this by implementing the solution in Python using sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the parameter\nx, omega = sp.symbols('x omega')\n\n# Define the function\nf = sp.sin(omega * x + sp.pi / 3)\n\n# The distance between adjacent symmetry axes is pi\n# This means the period of the function is 2*pi, but we only need half of it (pi)\n# The period of sin(omega * x) is 2*pi/omega, so half of it is pi/omega\n# We are given that this half-period is pi\nhalf_period = sp.pi / omega\n\n# Set the half-period equal to pi and solve for omega\nomega_value = sp.solve(half_period - sp.pi, omega)[0]\nprint(omega_value)\n```\n```output\n1\n```\nThe value of $\\omega$ for the function $f(x) = \\sin(\\omega x + \\frac{\\pi}{3})$ given that the distance between its two adjacent symmetry axes is $\\pi$ is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).\n\nGiven the function $f(x)=\\sin (2x+ \\frac {\\pi}{3})+\\sin (2x- \\frac {\\pi}{3})+2\\cos ^{2}x-1$, where $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n1. Find the smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$.\n2. Find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ in the interval $\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]$. Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin (A + B) + \\sin (A - B) = 2 \\sin A \\cos B \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2 \\sin 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin 2x \\]\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos 2x \\]\n\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are attained within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's find the values of \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) at the endpoints of the interval:\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n- When \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\)\n\nThe function \\( \\sin \\theta \\) attains its maximum value of 1 at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and its minimum value of -1 at \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Since \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is within the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right]\\), the maximum value of \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is 1 and the minimum value is -1 within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and SymPy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nf = sp.sin(2*x + sp.pi/3) + sp.sin(2*x - sp.pi/3) + 2*sp.cos(x)**2 - 1\n\n# Simplify the function\nf_simplified = sp.simplify(f)\nprint(f\"Simplified function: {f_simplified}\")\n\n# Find the period of the function\nperiod = sp.periodicity(f_simplified, x)\nprint(f\"Smallest positive period: {period}\")\n\n# Find the maximum and minimum values in the interval [-pi/4, pi/4]\ninterval = (-sp.pi/4, sp.pi/4)\ncritical_points = sp.solveset(sp.diff(f_simplified, x), x, domain=sp.Interval(*interval))\nvalues = [f_simplified.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points] + [f_simplified.subs(x, interval[0]), f_simplified.subs(x, interval[1])]\nmax_value = max(values)\nmin_value = min(values)\nprint(f\"Maximum value in the interval: {max_value}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum value in the interval: {min_value}\")\n```\n```output\nSimplified function: sqrt("], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

This indicates that the Sb has diffused to the depth \\(x\\) and the bulk concentration is the same as the surface concentration.\n\nTherefore, the donor concentration in the bulk germanium is the same as the surface concentration, which is \\(8 \\times 10^{18} \\, \\text{cm}^{-3}\\).\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8.00 \\times 10^{18}}\n\\]\n\nGiven that the function $f(x)$ is an odd function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$, and when $x > 0$, $f(x)=1- \\log _{2}x$, determine the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$. To solve the problem, we need to determine the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ given that $f(x)$ is an odd function and $f(x) = 1 - \\log_2 x$ for $x > 0$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an odd function, we know that $f(-x) = -f(x)$. Therefore, for $x < 0$, we have $f(x) = -f(-x) = -(1 - \\log_2 (-x)) = \\log_2 (-x) - 1$.\n\nWe need to consider two cases: $x > 0$ and $x < 0$.\n\n1. For $x > 0$, we have $f(x) = 1 - \\log_2 x$. We need to solve the inequality $1 - \\log_2 x < 0$.\n2. For $x < 0$, we have $f(x) = \\log_2 (-x) - 1$. We need to solve the inequality $\\log_2 (-x) - 1 < 0$.\n\nLet's solve these inequalities step-by-step.\n\n### Case 1: $x > 0$\nWe need to solve $1 - \\log_2 x < 0$.\n\\[\n1 - \\log_2 x < 0 \\implies \\log_2 x > 1 \\implies x > 2^1 \\implies x > 2\n\\]\nSo, the solution for $x > 0$ is $x > 2$.\n\n### Case 2: $x < 0$\nWe need to solve $\\log_2 (-x) - 1 < 0$.\n\\[\n\\log_2 (-x) - 1 < 0 \\implies \\log_2 (-x) < 1 \\implies -x < 2^1 \\implies -x < 2 \\implies x > -2\n\\]\nSo, the solution for $x < 0$ is $-2 < x < 0$.\n\nCombining both cases, the solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ is $(-2, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)$.\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and sympy.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function for x > 0\nf_pos = 1 - sp.log(x, 2)\n\n# Solve the inequality for x > 0\ninequality_pos = sp.solve(f_pos < 0, x)\n\n# Define the function for x < 0\nf_neg = sp.log(-x, 2) - 1\n\n# Solve the inequality for x < 0\ninequality_neg = sp.solve(f_neg < 0, x)\n\n# Combine the solutions\nsolution_set = sp.Union(inequality_neg, inequality_pos)\nprint(solution_set)\n```\n```output\nTypeError: Input args to Union must be Sets\n```\nThe error indicates that the inputs to the `Union` function must be sets. We need to ensure that the solutions from `solve` are converted to sets before using `Union`. Let's correct the code accordingly.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function for x > 0\nf_pos = 1 - sp.log(x, 2)\n\n# Solve the inequality for x > 0\ninequality_pos = sp.solveset(f_pos < 0, x, domain=sp.S.Reals)\n\n# Define the function for x < 0\nf_neg = sp.log(-x, 2) - 1\n\n# Solve the inequality for x < 0\ninequality_neg = sp.solveset(f_neg < 0, x, domain=sp.S.Reals)\n\n# Combine the solutions\nsolution_set = sp.Union(inequality_neg, inequality_pos)\nprint(solution_set)\n```\n```output\nUnion(Interval.open(-2, 0), Interval.open(2, oo))\n```\nThe output confirms our solution. The solution set for the inequality $f(x) < 0$ is the union of the intervals $(-2, 0)$ and $(2, \\infty)$. Therefore, the solution set is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-2, 0) \\cup (2, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\nGiven the function $f(x)=\\sin (2x+ \\frac {\\pi}{3})+\\sin (2x- \\frac {\\pi}{3})+2\\cos ^{2}x-1$, where $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n1. Find the smallest positive period of the function $f(x)$.\n2. Find the maximum and minimum values of the function $f(x)$ in the interval $\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]$. Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin (A + B) + \\sin (A - B) = 2 \\sin A \\cos B \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2 \\sin 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin 2x \\]\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos 2x \\]\n\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are attained within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's find the values of \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) at the endpoints of the interval:\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n- When \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\)\n\nThe function \\( \\sin \\theta \\) attains its maximum value of 1 at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and its minimum value of -1 at \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Since \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is within the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right]\\), the maximum value of \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is 1 and the minimum value is -1 within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and SymPy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nf = sp.sin(2*x + sp.pi/3) + sp.sin(2*x - sp.pi/3) + 2*sp.cos(x)**2 - 1\n\n# Simplify the function\nf_simplified = sp.simplify(f)\nprint(f\"Simplified function: {f_simplified}\")\n\n# Find the period of the function\nperiod = sp.periodicity(f_simplified, x)\nprint(f\"Smallest positive period: {period}\")\n\n# Find the maximum and minimum values in the interval [-pi/4, pi/4]\ninterval = (-sp.pi/4, sp.pi/4)\ncritical_points = sp.solveset(sp.diff(f_simplified, x), x, domain=sp.Interval(*interval))\nvalues = [f_simplified.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points] + [f_simplified.subs(x, interval[0]), f_simplified.subs(x, interval[1])]\nmax_value = max(values)\nmin_value = min(values"], "pred": ["(-2,0)\\cup(2,\\infty)"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Then, the value of $f(2016)$ is __(    )__.\nA: $1$\nB: $-1$\nC: $0$\nD: $2$ To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the function $f(x)$ given in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Even Function Property**: Since $f(x)$ is an even function, we have $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2. **Functional Equation**: The given functional equation is $f(x) = -f(2 - x)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n3. **Given Value**: We know that $f(2) = -1$.\n\nUsing these properties, we can find the value of $f(2016)$. Let's start by using the functional equation to find a pattern or a specific value.\n\nFirst, let's substitute $x = 0$ into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(0) = -f(2). \\]\nSince $f(2) = -1$, we have:\n\\[ f(0) = -(-1) = 1. \\]\n\nNext, let's substitute $x = 2$ into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(2) = -f(0). \\]\nSince $f(2) = -1$ and $f(0) = 1$, this is consistent.\n\nNow, let's substitute $x = 4$ into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(4) = -f(-2). \\]\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function, $f(-2) = f(2) = -1$, so:\n\\[ f(4) = -(-1) = 1. \\]\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging. Let's substitute $x = 6$ into the functional equation:\n\\[ f(6) = -f(-4). \\]\nSince $f(x)$ is an even function, $f(-4) = f(4) = 1$, so:\n\\[ f(6) = -1. \\]\n\nWe can generalize this pattern. For any even number $2k$, we have:\n\\[ f(2k) = (-1)^k. \\]\n\nSince 2016 is an even number, we can write $2016 = 2 \\cdot 1008$. Therefore:\n\\[ f(2016) = (-1)^{1008} = 1. \\]\n\nSo the value of $f(2016)$ is $1$.

Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use the sum-to-product identities and trigonometric identities to simplify this function. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin(A) + \\sin(B) = 2 \\sin \\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right) \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin \\left(2x\\right) \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin (2x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin (2x) \\]\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos (2x) \\]\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin (2x) + \\cos (2x) \\]\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin (2x) + \\cos (2x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nTo verify, we can check the values of \\( f(x) \\) at the endpoints and critical points within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python using SymPy to confirm our results.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nf = sp.sqrt(2) * sp.sin(2*x + sp.pi/4)\n\n# Find the period of the function\nperiod = sp.periodicity(f, x)\n\n# Find the maximum and minimum values in the interval [-pi/4, pi/4]\ninterval = [-sp.pi/4, sp.pi/4]\ncritical_points = sp.solveset(sp.diff(f, x), x, domain=sp.Interval(interval[0], interval[1]))\nvalues = [f.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points] + [f.subs(x, interval[0]), f.subs(x, interval[1])]\nmax_value = max(values)\nmin_value = min(values)\n\nprint(f\"Smallest positive period: {period}\")\nprint(f\"Maximum value in the interval: {max_value}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum value in the interval: {min_value}\")\n```\n```output\nSmallest positive period: pi\nMaximum value in the interval: sqrt(2)\nMinimum value in the interval: -1\n```\nIt appears there was a discrepancy in the minimum value calculation. The function \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) should indeed have a minimum value of \\(-\\sqrt{2}\\) over the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac {\\pi}{4}, \\frac {\\pi}{4}\\right]\\). Let's verify this by examining the function values at the critical points and endpoints more carefully.\n\nThe critical points are where the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is zero. The derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[ f'(x) = 2\\sqrt{2} \\cos \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\nSetting \\( f'(x) = 0 \\), we get:\n\\[ \\cos \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 0 \\]\nThis gives us:\n\\[ 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2"], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}

Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe given function is:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + 2\\cos^2 x - 1 \\]\n\nWe can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that:\n\\[ \\sin (A + B) + \\sin (A - B) = 2 \\sin A \\cos B \\]\nSo,\n\\[ \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\sin \\left(2x - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2 \\sin 2x \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 2 \\sin 2x \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\sin 2x \\]\n\nAlso, recall that:\n\\[ 2\\cos^2 x - 1 = \\cos 2x \\]\n\nSo the function simplifies to:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x \\]\n\nUsing the identity \\( \\sin 2x + \\cos 2x = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\), we get:\n\\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the smallest positive period of the function \\( f(x) \\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a period of \\( \\pi \\) because the coefficient of \\( x \\) inside the sine function is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive period of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\pi \\).\n\n### Step 3: Find the maximum and minimum values of the function \\( f(x) \\) in the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\)\nThe function \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) has a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{2} \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nHowever, we need to check if these values are attained within the interval \\(\\left[- \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right]\\).\n\nLet's find the values of \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\) at the endpoints of the interval:\n- When \\( x = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\)\n- When \\( x = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\), \\( 2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\)\n\nThe function \\( \\sin \\theta \\) attains its maximum value of 1 at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and its minimum value of -1 at \\( \\theta = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). Since \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is within the interval \\(\\left[-\\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right]\\), the maximum value of \\( \\sin \\left(2x + \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) \\) is 1 and the minimum value is -1 within the interval.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) and the minimum value is \\( -\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\nLet's confirm this with Python and SymPy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = sp.symbols('x')\nf = sp.sin(2*x + sp.pi/3) + sp.sin(2*x - sp.pi/3) + 2*sp.cos(x)**2 - 1\n\n# Simplify the function\nf_simplified = sp.simplify(f)\nprint(f\"Simplified function: {f_simplified}\")\n\n# Find the period of the function\nperiod = sp.periodicity(f_simplified, x)\nprint(f\"Smallest positive period: {period}\")\n\n# Find the maximum and minimum values in the interval [-pi/4, pi/4]\ninterval = (-sp.pi/4, sp.pi/4)\ncritical_points = sp.solveset(sp.diff(f_simplified, x), x, domain=sp.Interval(*interval))\nvalues = [f_simplified.subs(x, point) for point in critical_points] + [f_simplified.subs(x, interval[0]), f_simplified.subs(x, interval[1])]\nmax_value = max(values)\nmin_value = min(values)\nprint(f\"Maximum value in the interval: {max_value}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum value in the interval: {min_value}\")\n```\n```output\nSimplified function: sqrt(2)*sin(2*x + pi/4)\nSmallest positive period: pi\nMaximum value in the interval: sqrt(2)\nMinimum value in the interval: -1\n```\nThe output"], "pred": ["0<a\\le\\frac{\\pi}{12}"], "report": [null], "score": [false]}
